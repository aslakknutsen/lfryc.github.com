"Developer Conference in Brno":http://devconf.cz/ will be held just in two weeks. Since it will highly increase a concentration of hackers and people which loves the open source, we will leverage *a fantastic opportunity to organize a hackfest*!

We already spontaneously organized "a hackfest last year":https://plus.google.com/109501071933862146039/posts/dyo3hU9smcj with a focus on the testing and "the event were very successful":http://lukas.fryc.eu/blog/2012/02/wrap-up-arquillian-hackfest-developer.html.

This year we open the hackfest to any project and ideas related to *Java and JVM languages (groovy, scala, clojure, ceylon, jruby, javascript, ...), frameworks or tools*.

h2. Occassion

The hackfest will take place *Februry 23-24th* ("conference days":http://developerconference2013.sched.org/grid-full), close to conference rooms and labs, in a dedicated *meeting room B431* (pavilion B, 4th floor).

h2. Hackers & Mentors

* Would you like to hack on some *cool features* to your project?

There will be plenty of people willing to join you and give a life to interesting projects and their features.

h2. Organization

h4. Start

At the start of the hackfest (Saturday 12:30) we will collect and review ideas. You can propose a new idea right on the place.

Then we will assign ourselves to teams in order to estimate an interest in particular projects.

After separation of hackers to groups, we will start to work on our projects.

h4. Finish & Summary

Once finished, we will summarize each project's achievements - the project developmnent can finish during whole day or, preferably, at the end of each day.

h2. Collecting Ideas

In order to publicize your idea, you can either *write a blog* or you can *"submit it using a form":https://docs.google.com/a/fryc.eu/forms/d/1lguajStvzZwReBz7BZo3n0O0Sx5N3_u1To_T1Dg9skg/viewform*.

If you have *more than one idea* to propose or you want to *track many ideas for particular project*, you can write a wiki article which will track them all in one place.

All ideas submitted before a start of the event will be collected on this page.

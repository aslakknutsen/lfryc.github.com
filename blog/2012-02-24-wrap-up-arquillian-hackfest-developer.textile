Thank **all participants for contributing** to discussions on Arquillian HackFest!

The **10 people has attended** and shared their ideas on selected topics,
and others came to see us on video stream and IRC channel!


<a href="https://plus.google.com/109501071933862146039/posts/dyo3hU9smcj" target="_blank">The initial idea for this Hackfest</a> has arisen when we were discussing the topics we would like to cover in conference days, just after **Arquillian SPI talk from Aslak**.


Although we wasn't able to cover all declared topics,
we focused on the ones which were most related to incoming Arquillians,
the **notes and white-boards** can be find here:

**<a href="https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-organization/wiki/Future:-gwt" target="_blank">Future: GWT</a>**

**<a href="https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-organization/wiki/Future:-javascript" target="_blank">Future: JavaScript</a>**

**<a href="https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-organization/wiki/Future:-performance-testing" target="_blank">Future: Performance testing</a>**

**Future: JSFUnit.NG**
( no notes here, it was really short session - after Arquillian SPI talks, it didn't left much more to discuss - thanks Aslak! )


It was pleasure to see so much ideas flowing,** let's grab them and equip Ike with even more mighty weapons** for fighting with bugs. ;-)

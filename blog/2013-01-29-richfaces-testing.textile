As we announced earlier, we are undergoing several changes to an approach how RichFaces are tested. We already have an extensive functional test suite authored by a top-notch RichFaces QE team, but *this suite doesn't allow us react quickly on regressions* we introduced and so we usually find some of them during a release testing.

We came to a conclusion that we are doing *testing too late after a commit* and that the *tests we have are too far from final deployment scenario* - they are not real enough.

h3. The Integration Environment Complexity

The problem which we face is given by a complexity of the client-server nature of web frameworks like the JSF.

In the RichFaces, we build on top of client-side libraries (jQuery, jQuery UI, etc.) and we let them communicate through a JSF client-side library with a JSF backend on an application server.

The testing of the client-side interaction is then so complex that it is often avoided. But while one can avoid the interaction testing, he is underestimating its importance.

h4. Standard approaches

The code we write can be easily unit tested and so we test regularly both, its client-side and its server-side part.

But the real units we need to test are JSF components which are composed from a client-side code, XML templates, a Java code and a XML configuration. There are just limited options to test them and none of them is really 

So that's a point when it usually comes to integration testing (also called  component testing).

h5. Mocking

Someone could think that this is kind of the interaction which can be tested by mocks. So we did.

But at the end we end up with many mocks and we got nothing else than extra work for compiler and huge amount of code to maintain. Yeah, it was pretty fast, but it didn't guard us from evil bugs.

Using mocks for a component or an integration testing is no way to success.

h3. Arquillian for the Rescue

Fortunately, there is one team, which lives with the idea "Stop Mocking at All" in mind and it focuses on getting the testing real again.

h4. Effortless Test Harness

Arquillian integrates with (almost) every application container out there in unified manner, so it's very easy to set your application for a cross-container testing.

For a packaging of application pieces, you can leverage a ShrinkWrap API to achieve either packaging micro-deployments or whole applications easily (ShrinWrap Resolvers). Additionally, you can use fluent API for describing deployment configuration (ShrinkWrap Descriptors).

h4. Get Me Real Browser

From the perspective of a web UI testing it important that Arquillian allows to control real browsers using the Drone extension. Drone brings the browser to the test and exposes it to you using widely-adopted WebDriver API (similarly to Arquillian core bringing you in-container components).

div(alert alert-info). Note: WebDriver is Selenium 2 API, which is being in process of W3C standardation as Browser Automation

No matter which browser you use, you will write the same test just once and you will be empowered to run it on (almost) every browser out there in unified manner.

That way, you can run your tests everywhere:

* on various versions of all *desktop browsers*
* on various *mobile devices* (emulated or real)
* on *mocked browsers* (yeah, the same we have spurned before)
* remotely on *virtualized browser grids* (on-demand)
* remotely using the *cloud browser provider*

h4. Arquillian Saves the Day

With Arquillian, you can let browser of your choice to talk to the application server of your choice.

But you can do much more.

h3. Gray-Box Testing

h4. Warp your test from Client to Server

In server-side web frameworks, you typically do complex interactions which involves portion of client-side code and portion of server-side state manipulation. But how to test more complex interactions? What happens when we trigger client-side code (e.g. hit a button)? What is the reaction on the server-side (e.g. CDI events is raised)?

That's exactly where Arquillian's Warp extension comes in - it allows you to write tests as combination of client-side activities and inspect what's happening in server as simply as

bc(prettify).. Warp
    .initiate(Activity)
    .inspect(Inspection);

p. It allows to perform anything you can do on client-side and once your client makes a HTTP request to a server, you can inspect what happens on server-side (by testing state injected to the test, similarly to Arquillian's in-container testing).

In the words of JSF, you can manipulate with JSF components on the page and you can inspect what happens during JSF lifecycle with their state, with a state of beans or even what messages were produced as the response to user's action.

The Warp is outstanding servant when it comes to testing the real client-server interaction.

h3. Testing AJAX-heavy applications

You could be all setup now, but you will quickly get to the conclusion that WebDriver itself isn't strong to deal with highly-interactive applications as RichFaces are. That is exactly where Graphene comes in.

Graphene allows you to precisely and concisely describe what interactions happen in the browser so the test will execute deterministically:

bc(prettify).. addButton.click();
waitGui().until().element(newRecord).is().present();

assertEquals(..., newRecord.getText());

p. Ironically, it is even simpler to wait for updates from a server, since Graphene allows you to intercept a communication and it blocks test execution until the communication ends:

bc(prettify).. searchInput.sendKeys("Java Testing Platform");
guardXhr(searchButton).click();
assertEquals("Arquillian", searchResults.get(0).getText());

h3. Page Abstractions

Using WebDriver API, you need to manipulate with the simplest APIs in the web: HTML, DOM, CSS, JavaScript. The tests might quickly become hard to read and maintain.

That's why we have adopted Page Objects pattern which tells you to abstract the complexity to reusable pieces.

In Graphene, you can define so called Page Fragments, which will allow you to abstract small pieces of the pages which are used repeatedly and reuse them through the whole project.

In the world of JSF, those pieces might be JSF components:

bc(prettify).. @FindBy(id = "form:birthDate")
RichfacesCalendar birthDate;

@Test
public void test() {
    birthDate.setDate(xyz);
}

p. The same way you abstract your server-side business logic, you can abstract your definitions on the page.

div(alert alert-info). Note: we intend to abstract all RichFaces components so you could reuse them in your projects

h2. Conclusion

The Arquillian opens you pretty new testing experience - it makes writing tests as easy as unit testing, while keeping the tests real, concise and fun to write.

h2. Next Time

This is a first part of a serie which looks under the hood how we are testing the RichFaces framework.

In the next parts, I will show you how to:

* develop integration tests fast and effectively
* run integration tests in continuous integration

That's it for now, so let's look forward for next parts of this serie!

You have been requesting and we now answer: RichFaces gets pretty new Editor component, which was lacking from 4.0.0.Final release.



This component can be found in upcoming <span style="font-weight: bold;">4.1.0.Milestone1</span> release and is mostly feature complete with exception of skinning which will fit to rest of component suite - this functionality is targeted for Milestone 2.



Editor component is using <a href="http://ckeditor.com/">CKEditor</a> implementation internally and it is able to switch between two configurations of toolbar set: <span style="font-weight: bold;">basic</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">full</span>.



<a href="/images/blog/2011-08-15-editor-for-richfaces-41/Screenshot-23.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 275px;" src="/images/blog/2011-08-15-editor-for-richfaces-41/Screenshot-23.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5640099601474847346" border="0" /></a>



It also integrates nicely with rest of JSF 2, thus you can bind e.g. <span style="font-weight: bold;">behavior for event</span> denoting the editor content has been changed:

bc.. <rich:editor toolbar="full" value="\#{article.text}">
   <a4j:ajax event="change" action="\#{article.save}" />
</rich:editor>

p. It is important to note that Editor uses <span style="font-weight: bold;">resource handling servlet</span> for obtaining own resources. You donâ€™t require any additional configuration to set it up when working with Servlet 3.0 - everything will be registered automatically for you.



However in Servlet 2.5 and older environments, it is necessary to register this servlet manually in web.xml:

bc.. <servlet>
   <servlet-name>Resource Servlet</servlet-name>
   <servlet-class>org.richfaces.webapp.ResourceServlet</servlet-class>
   <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
   <servlet-name>Resource Servlet</servlet-name>
   <url-pattern>/org.richfaces.resources/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>


p. I would appreciate <a href="http://community.jboss.org/en/richfaces">your feedback on forums</a>, how this component stands.

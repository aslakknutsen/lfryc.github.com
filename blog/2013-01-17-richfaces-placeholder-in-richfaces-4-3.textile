In RichFaces 4.3 we are following up on great work from "Bernard Labno":https://plus.google.com/112932410824491900575/posts who put together the predecessor of @<rich:placeholder />@ component and published in the "RichFaces Sandbox":https://github.com/richfaces/sandbox.

This component gives you ability similar to HTML5's placeholder - it pre-fills form inputs with a text, which serves as a hint for a user what data are expected to be filled in. Once you change the input, the placeholder text will disappear.

You can try that on the sample bellow:

<input type="text" placeholder="Placeholder text" />

h5. So why you need new component?

Placeholder doesn't work in older browsers, so to ensure backward compatibility, you would need to use JavaScript plugins like the one we have used: @$.watermark@.

With RichFaces, you can leverage that as simple as:

bc(prettify).. <h:inputText value="...">
    <rich:placeholder value="Type text here..." />
</h:inputText>

h5. Example

<a href="http://showcase.richfaces.org/richfaces/component-sample.jsf?demo=placeholder&skin=blueSky"><img src="../../../images/blog/2013-01-17-richfaces-placeholder-in-richfaces-4-3/placeholder.png" /></a>

h3. Additional features

h4. Placeholder styling

You can style the placeholder text using the CSS

bc(prettify).. .rf-plhdr {
   color: #eee
}

p. or for each component specifically with @styleClass@:

bc(prettify).. <rich:placeholder styleClass="my-special-placeholder" />

h4. Apply placeholder to multiple components

In order to apply placeholder to multiple components, you need to use @@selector@ attribute:

bc(prettify).. <h:inputText styleClass ="my-placeholder" />
<h:inputText styleClass ="my-placeholder" />
<rich:placeholder selector=".my-placeholder" text="Fill in..." />

h4. Support for wide-range of components

We also make sure that @<rich:placeholder />@ works with wide-range of RichFaces components, so you don't need to cope with incompatibilities.


h4. Give it a try

You can try this component in a "sample in RichFaces Showcase":http://showcase.richfaces.org/richfaces/component-sample.jsf?demo=placeholder&skin=blueSky.

You can also look into "component's reference":http://docs.jboss.org/richfaces/4.3.X/4.3.0.CR1/Component_Reference/en-US/html/chap-Component_Reference-Functionality_extension.html#sect-Component_Reference-Functionality_extension-richplaceholder and "VDL documentation":http://docs.jboss.org/richfaces/4.3.X/4.3.0.CR1/vdldoc/rich/placeholder.html.
